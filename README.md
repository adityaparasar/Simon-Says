# Saimon Says

This Project is a web based classic memory and attention game where colored lights blink sequentially.

# Features
1. Coloured block blinks randomly and players have to memorize the colour.
2. Players need to select the colored blocks in the exact order they were illuminated previously.
3. Upon correctly choosing the colors in the same sequence, progressing to the next level is possible; otherwise, the game will be over.
